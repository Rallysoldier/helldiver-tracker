project details:

Technical Specs:
We are creating a discord bot in the sapphire framework
We have node.js v20.18.0 installed on the machine, but not configured for the project
We have npm 10.8.2 installed on the machine, but not configured for the project
We have lint installed, but not configured for the project.

Base goals/must haves:
The goal is for the bot to be able to track members who are currently 
playing HELLDIVERS 2, then update a message or infographic in a 
discord channel, displaying the members. 
It should be able to update when members get on the game, 
as well as get off. 
It should also have the functionality to @Neural Interfaced, 
notifying the role of updates
